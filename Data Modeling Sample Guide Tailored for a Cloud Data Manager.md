## 1. **Business & Regulatory Context**

The Gambling Commission’s primary mission is to ensure fair gaming practices, protect consumers, and enforce regulatory standards. In your role, you’ll be responsible for ensuring that data solutions not only support day-to-day operations (like player profiles, bets, and transactions) but also meet strict compliance, security, and performance standards. This guide is designed to help you create a data architecture that supports seamless data integration, advanced analytics, and secure governance in a cloud environment.

## 2. **Data Modeling Lifecycle Overview**

### **Conceptual Data Modeling**

- **Identify Core Entities:**  
  Define major subjects such as:
  - **Player:** Information about individuals placing bets.
  - **Account:** Financial records including deposits, withdrawals, and balances.
  - **Bet:** Details of each wager (bet type, amount, odds, outcome).
  - **Game:** Metadata about various games (casino, sports, lottery).
  - **Transaction:** Records of money movement.
  - **ComplianceRecord:** AML, KYC, and audit logs.
  - **License & AuditLog:** Additional regulatory and operational tracking.

- **Map Relationships:**  
  For example:
  - A **Player** can have one or more **Accounts**.
  - Each **Account** logs multiple **Transactions**.
  - **Bets** link **Players** (via Accounts) to specific **Games**.
  - **ComplianceRecords** are associated with both **Players** and **Accounts**.

### **Logical Data Modeling**

- **Refine Entities with Attributes:**  
  Define entities with attributes that capture all necessary details. For instance:

  **Player**  
  - *PlayerID* (PK)  
  - FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, etc.

  **Account**  
  - *AccountID* (PK)  
  - PlayerID (FK), AccountNumber, Balance, Currency, Status, CreationDate

  **Bet**  
  - *BetID* (PK)  
  - AccountID (FK), GameID (FK), BetDate, BetAmount, Odds, Outcome, Payout

- **Normalization:**  
  Ensure tables follow normalization rules (up to 3NF) to avoid redundancy and maintain data integrity.

- **Relationship Resolution:**  
  Use junction tables (e.g., **PlayerAccount**) for many-to-many relationships.

### **Physical Data Modeling**

- **Schema Implementation on Azure:**  
  Utilize Microsoft Azure services to implement your physical data model. Your design should include:
  - **Azure SQL Database:** For transactional data and relational schemas.
  - **Azure Data Lake Storage & Blob Storage:** For large-scale raw and processed data storage.
  - **Azure Synapse Analytics:** For scalable data warehousing and analytical workloads.

- **Sample SQL Schema:**  
  Below is an example using PostgreSQL-like syntax (adaptable for Azure SQL):

  ```sql
  -- Player Table
  CREATE TABLE Player (
      PlayerID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
      DateOfBirth DATE NOT NULL,
      Gender VARCHAR(10),
      Address TEXT,
      ContactNumber VARCHAR(15),
      Email VARCHAR(100),
      RegistrationDate DATE NOT NULL
  );

  -- Account Table
  CREATE TABLE Account (
      AccountID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      PlayerID INT REFERENCES Player(PlayerID),
      AccountNumber VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
      Balance DECIMAL(12,2),
      Currency VARCHAR(10),
      Status VARCHAR(20),
      CreationDate DATE NOT NULL
  );

  -- Bet Table
  CREATE TABLE Bet (
      BetID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      AccountID INT REFERENCES Account(AccountID),
      GameID INT REFERENCES Game(GameID),
      BetDate TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
      BetAmount DECIMAL(10,2),
      Odds DECIMAL(5,2),
      BetOutcome VARCHAR(20),
      Payout DECIMAL(10,2)
  );

  -- Game Table
  CREATE TABLE Game (
      GameID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      GameType VARCHAR(50),
      GameName VARCHAR(100),
      Provider VARCHAR(100),
      LaunchDate DATE
  );

  -- Transaction Table
  CREATE TABLE Transaction (
      TransactionID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      AccountID INT REFERENCES Account(AccountID),
      TransactionDate TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
      TransactionType VARCHAR(50),
      Amount DECIMAL(12,2),
      Description TEXT
  );

  -- Compliance Record Table
  CREATE TABLE ComplianceRecord (
      ComplianceID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      PlayerID INT REFERENCES Player(PlayerID),
      AccountID INT REFERENCES Account(AccountID),
      AMLCheck BOOLEAN,
      KYCDetails TEXT,
      AuditTrail TEXT,
      RecordDate DATE NOT NULL
  );

  -- License Table
  CREATE TABLE License (
      LicenseID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      OperatorName VARCHAR(100),
      LicenseNumber VARCHAR(50),
      IssueDate DATE NOT NULL,
      ExpiryDate DATE NOT NULL,
      Jurisdiction VARCHAR(100)
  );

  -- Audit Log Table
  CREATE TABLE AuditLog (
      AuditID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      UserID INT,
      ActionPerformed TEXT,
      Timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
      Details TEXT
  );

  -- Junction Table for Many-to-Many Player-Account Relationship
  CREATE TABLE PlayerAccount (
      PlayerID INT REFERENCES Player(PlayerID),
      AccountID INT REFERENCES Account(AccountID),
      PRIMARY KEY (PlayerID, AccountID)
  );
  ```
